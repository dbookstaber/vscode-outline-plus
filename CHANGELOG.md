# Changelog

All notable changes to the "region-helper" extension will be documented in this file.

This changelog adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) and is structured for clarity and readability, inspired by [Common Changelog](https://common-changelog.org/) and [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [1.5.3] - 2025-12-20

- Slight adjustments to README, and also a re-publish attempt since VSCode seemed to silently fail to fully publish v1.5.2

## [1.5.2] - 2025-12-17

- Remove `.mypy_cache/` from published package to reduce package size

## [1.5.1] - 2025-12-17

- **Fix/add default region pattern support for .NET languages**:
  - **C#**: Correct the default region boundary patterns config for C#, to properly match C#'s native `#region` and `#endregion` directives (rather than `// #region` and `// #endregion` comment markers)
  - **Visual Basic**: Add Visual Basic's native `#Region` and `#End Region` directive patterns to the default region boundary patterns configuration

## [1.5.0] - 2025-05-22

- **Improve auto-highlighting of active tree view items**: The Regions and Full Outline views now only auto-highlight their active item when the view is visible, removing the need for the user to toggle auto-highlighting off when wanting to remain in another panel (e.g. Search) or keep a view collapsed

## [1.4.1] - 2025-05-20

- **Extend block comment region pattern support**
  - Add block comment region syntax (e.g. `/* #region */`) to default region boundary patterns configuration for `javascript`, `javascriptreact`, `typescript`, `typescriptreact`, and `vue` languages.
  - Adjust block comment region syntax for `less`, `css`, `postcss`, `scss`, and the above JS-based languages to allow for one or more opening/closing asterisks, e.g. `/** #region */` or `/*** #endregion ***/`

## [1.4.0] - 2025-05-14

- **Add Collapse/Expand All actions**: Action buttons added to the Regions and Full Outline tree views' title bars to collapse or expand all tree items
- **Add persistent tree view state**: Expanded/collapsed items are remembered when switching files or restarting VS Code
- **Fix PHP default region support:** Add `#region` and `#endregion` region syntax to default PHP boundary patterns configuration

## [1.3.0] - 2025-03-18

## [1.2.0] - 2025-03-11

## [1.1.0] - 2025-03-09

- **Add Full Outline View**: A new tree view combining **regions and language symbols**.
- **Expose API access to Full Outline Data**, allowing other extensions to retrieve and listen to full outline items.
- **Improve region tree UI**: Region items now use the `symbol-namespace` icon for a more **consistent look**.
- **Enhance selection behavior**: "Select Current Region" now extends the selection to the **end of the last line**.
- **Optimize performance**: **More robust debouncing** ensures smoother updates, especially in **large files**.
